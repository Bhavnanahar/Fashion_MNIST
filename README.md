![Fashion MNIST](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/68/Fashion-MNIST-logo.png)

## 📋 Project Description
This project is an image classification task using the **Fashion MNIST** dataset, a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of 10 different fashion items such as shoes, bags, and shirts. The goal is to build a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify the images into the correct categories.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍
- **TensorFlow** 📊
- **Keras** 🧠
- **NumPy** ➗
- **Matplotlib** 📈
- **Pandas** 🗃️

## 🛠️ Features
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Used for image classification.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Train the model and evaluate its accuracy.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalize and preprocess the images.
- **Visualizations**: Plot model performance (accuracy/loss graphs).
- **Deployable**: Option to deploy model via a web interface (Flask/Streamlit).

## 🔥 Key Steps
1. **Data Loading** 📥  
   Load the Fashion MNIST dataset using TensorFlow.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing** 🧹  
   Normalize the images and one-hot encode the labels.

3. **Model Building** 🏗️  
   Build the CNN model using multiple convolutional layers, max-pooling, and a fully connected output layer.

4. **Model Training** 📊  
   Train the model using the training dataset and evaluate using the test dataset.
